# INTEL DOSSIER: Jan Koller (The OPPONENT) - FORENSIC UPDATE

## 📡 Verified Hard Data
*   **Role**: Member (Physics Dept Connection)
*   **Risk Level**: 🟥 CRITICAL

## 📚 Verified Context
*   **Niche**: **Plasma Physics** and **Materials Science**.

## 🔬 Research Obsessions
*   **Top 3 Recent Papers (2024)**:
    1.  *"Surface properties of polyimide treated by atmospheric pressure plasma jet"* (2024) -> **Materials / Plasma**.
    2.  *"Low-Temperature Deposition of Copper Layers for Flexible Electronics"* (2024) -> **Manufacturing / PCB**.
    3.  *"Comparative Study of Plasma-Aided Preparation..."*
*   **Key Insight**: He works on **modifying materials** (surfaces, layers) using **Plasma**.

## 🧠 Forensic Profile
*   **The Materialist**: He cares about the **Surface** and the **Layer**. If you printed a PCB, he might ask about the copper thickness or adhesion.
*   **The Plasma Guy**: He thinks in terms of *Energy* and *Ions*.

## ⚔️ Attack Vectors
1.  **Implication**: He is NOT just a "Solar" guy (hallucination fixed). He is a **Surface/Plasma** guy.
2.  **Question**: "Your sensor has a plastic casing. How does it react to UV or environmental stress?" (Relates to his surface treatment research).
3.  **Question**: "You used a PCB. How is the copper layer deposited?" (Relates to his customized copper deposition research).
