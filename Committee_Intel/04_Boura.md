# INTEL DOSSIER: Adam Bouřa (The Ally) - FORENSIC UPDATE

## 📡 Verified Hard Data
*   **Role**: Member
*   **Department**: Microelectronics

## 📚 Verified Teaching (The Source of Basic Questions)
*   **[B2B34SNB] Biomedical sensors**: Confirmed.
*   **[AD2B34SEI] Sensors in Electronics and Informatics**: The general sensor course.
*   **[B2B34MSY] Microsystems**: MEMS.

## 🔬 Research Obsessions
*   **Top 3 Recent Papers (2025)**:
    1.  *"Optimum wavelength selection for a POF-based soil moisture sensor"* (2025) -> **Optical Sensors**.
    2.  *"Characterization... of a transformer for LLC converter based on GaN"* (2025) -> **Power Electronics Components**.
*   **Key Insight**: He is building **Optical Soil Sensors**.

## 🧠 Forensic Profile
*   **The Practical Sensor Builder**: He builds *actual* sensors (soil moisture). He knows the pain of calibration.
*   **The Ally**: If you used any sensor, he is your guy. He recently worked on **Optical Fiber (POF)** sensors.

## ⚔️ Attack Vectors
1.  **Implication**: If you used a moisture sensor or optical sensor, he is the expert.
2.  **Question**: "POF (Plastic Optical Fibers) are cheap but have high attenuation. Why did you choose X wavelength?"
