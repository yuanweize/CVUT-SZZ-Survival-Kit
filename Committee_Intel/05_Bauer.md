## 📚 Verified Teaching (The Source of Basic Questions)
*   **[B3B34MKS] Microprocessors for Power Systems**: He teaches the **Chip**.
*   **[B1M14PVR] Digital Control of Electric Drives**: He teaches the **Code**.

## 🔬 Research Obsessions
*   **Top 3 Recent Papers (2025)**:
    1.  *"Digital Implementation of Discontinuous PWMs"* (2025) -> **PWM Algorithms**.
    2.  *"Analytical Harmonic Suppression in Overmodulated... Drives"* (2025) -> **Signal Quality**.
*   **Key Insight**: He is obsessed with **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** and **Digital Implementation**.

## 🧠 Forensic Profile
*   **The Firmware Architect**: He doesn't just want the motor to spin. He wants to know *how* you calculated the duty cycle.
*   **The Clean Signal Freak**: He writes papers on "Harmonic Suppression". He hates noise.

## ⚔️ Attack Vectors
1.  **Implication**: He will look at your code's **Interrupt Service Routine**.
2.  **Question**: "Your PWM signal... what is the harmonic content? Did you filter it?"
